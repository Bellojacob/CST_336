            MyDoom, first identified in <strong>January 2004</strong>, is one of the most destructive and fast-spreading email worms 
            in history. The virus primarily spread through infected email attachments that appeared as bounced messages 
            or seemingly legitimate files. When users clicked on the attachment, MyDoom would infect the system, 
            automatically harvesting email addresses from the user's contacts and sending itself to those addresses. 
            This self-replication mechanism allowed it to spread rapidly, causing a massive global outbreak.
            <br>
            <br>

            Once MyDoom infiltrated a system, it created a backdoor that allowed hackers to gain remote access 
            to the infected computer, enabling them to control the machine or use it as part of larger cyberattacks. 
            One of the most notorious aspects of MyDoom was its ability to launch Distributed Denial of Service <strong>(DDoS) </strong>
            attacks. These attacks overwhelmed major websites with traffic, causing significant disruptions. Google, 
            Yahoo, and other large websites were temporarily slowed or brought down due to the flood of traffic 
            caused by infected machines.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The financial damage caused by MyDoom is estimated to be over <strong>$38 billion</strong>, making it one of the 
            costliest viruses in history. It not only disrupted personal computers but also crippled businesses
             and internet infrastructure globally. The virus's ability to spread quickly, combined with its dual 
             functionality as a tool for email harvesting and DDoS attacks, solidified its place in cybersecurity 
             history as one of the most potent malware outbreaks.
