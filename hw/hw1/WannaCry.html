        <div class="container">
        <p class="info">WannaCry was a large-scale ransomware attack that took place in <strong>May 2017</strong>, 
            infecting over <strong>230,000</strong> computers across more than <strong>150</strong> countries. The ransomware exploited a vulnerability 
            in Microsoft Windows called EternalBlue, which was originally developed by the <abbr title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr> and later leaked by the hacking group 
            known as the Shadow Brokers. WannaCry spread rapidly across networks, encrypting files and demanding ransom 
            payments in Bitcoin to unlock the infected systems. Major victims of the attack included organizations 
            like Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), which suffered significant disruptions, including canceled 
            surgeries and appointments.

            <br>
            <br>

            The ransomware took advantage of the EternalBlue exploit to spread autonomously between systems, making it 
            particularly dangerous. Although Microsoft had issued a patch for the vulnerability two months before the attack, 
            many organizations had not yet updated their systems, leaving them vulnerable. Financial damages from the attack 
            were estimated to be between <strong>$4 billion - $8 billion</strong> globally due to operational downtime, lost productivity, 
            and costs related to recovery and ransom payments.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            A critical turning point in stopping WannaCry’s spread came when a security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, 
            discovered a “kill switch” embedded in the malware's code. By registering a specific domain name the malware 
            was querying, Hutchins inadvertently halted the infection’s rapid spread. However, systems that had already 
            been infected remained locked, and paying the ransom often did not result in files being decrypted as promised 
            by the attackers.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            The WannaCry attack emphasized the importance of regularly updating software and patching known security 
            vulnerabilities. It also highlighted the risks associated with using outdated operating systems, 
            as many victims were running older versions of Windows. Despite the attack being contained, the EternalBlue 
            exploit remains a significant tool in other cyberattacks, showcasing the long-lasting effects of the WannaCry 
            incident.
