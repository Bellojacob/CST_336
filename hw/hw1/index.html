                This webpage is designed to provide comprehensive insights into various viruses 
                that have emerged throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet" target="_blank"><em>history of the internet</em></a>, offering you a deeper 
                understanding of their impact and evolution.

                <strong>What is a computer virus?</strong>
    
                <br>
                <br>
    
                A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to replicate itself and 
                spread from one computer to another. It typically attaches itself to legitimate programs or files, and when the 
                infected file or program is opened, the virus activates, often without the user's knowledge. Once activated, it can 
                perform various harmful actions, such as corrupting or deleting data, disrupting system operations, 
                stealing personal information, or spreading to other systems.
    
                <br>
                <br>
    
                Viruses often spread through email attachments, 
                downloaded files, or infected external devices (like USB drives). A key characteristic of a virus is that 
                it requires human interaction (such as opening an infected file) to spread, unlike other types of malware that 
                may spread automatically through networks.

                Computer viruses have evolved significantly over time, from early nuisance programs to highly sophisticated 
                malware capable of causing widespread damage, as seen with viruses like MyDoom or WannaCry.

                <strong>What is ransomware?</strong>
    
                <br>
                <br>
    
            
                Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system or 
                encrypt a victim's files, demanding a ransom payment for their release. It typically spreads through 
                phishing emails, malicious attachments, or infected websites that exploit vulnerabilities in software. 
                Once the ransomware gains access to a system, it either locks the entire system or encrypts specific files, 
                making them inaccessible to the user. Victims are then prompted to pay a ransom, often in cryptocurrency 
                like Bitcoin, to receive a decryption key or regain access to their system.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are two main types of ransomware: locker ransomware and crypto ransomware. Locker ransomware locks 
                the user out of their device entirely, displaying a message that demands payment for access to be restored. 
                Crypto ransomware, on the other hand, encrypts valuable files such as documents, images, and databases, 
                making them unusable until a ransom is paid. While paying the ransom may sometimes unlock the files, there 
                is no guarantee that the attackers will follow through, and many cybersecurity experts advise against paying.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ransomware attacks have become increasingly prevalent and dangerous, 
                targeting individuals, businesses, and even critical infrastructure. High-profile ransomware 
                incidents have targeted healthcare systems, governments, and corporations, causing significant 
                disruptions and financial losses. The rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), where cybercriminals 
                offer ransomware kits to other attackers, has made it easier for less technically skilled individuals 
                to carry out these attacks. The best defenses against ransomware include maintaining strong cybersecurity 
                practices, regularly updating software, and backing up important data to minimize the impact of an attack.
