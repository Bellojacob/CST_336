        <p class="info">The ILOVEYOU virus, also known as the "Love Bug" or "Loveletter," is infamous 
            for being one of the most destructive and widespread computer viruses in history. First appearing 
            in May 2000, this worm propagated through email systems by tricking users into opening an attachment 
            disguised as a love letter. The subject line simply read "ILOVEYOU," which tempted many recipients into 
            clicking on the attached file, unleashing the virus.

            <br>

            Once the attachment was opened, the virus overwrote numerous types of files, 
            including important system files and personal data such as images, music, and documents. 
            It would then spread by automatically sending itself to the first 50 contacts in the infected user’s 
            email address book, thereby rapidly increasing its reach. This self-replicating nature allowed it to 
            spread globally in just a few hours, infecting over 10 million Windows-based computers​ History Tools.

            Major organizations were severely impacted, including the Pentagon, the CIA, and the UK Parliament, 
            forcing many institutions to shut down their email systems to prevent further damage. The financial 
            toll was enormous, with estimates suggesting that the virus caused over $10 billion in damages due to 
            lost productivity, data recovery, and system repair​

            ILOVEYOU exploited the human tendency to trust email attachments, marking a significant moment 
            in the history of cybersecurity. Its success also highlighted the vulnerability of email systems 
            and the importance of educating users about the dangers of social engineering​.
